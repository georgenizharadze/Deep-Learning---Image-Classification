## My academic project with Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

In this project, I have built a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identifies an estimate of the canine’s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  


## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
		cd dog-project
	```
2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 
3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 
4. Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.
5. Obtain the necessary Python packages, and switch Keras backend to Tensorflow.  
	
	For __Mac/OSX__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-mac.yml
		source activate aind-dog
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

	For __Linux__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-linux.yml
		source activate aind-dog
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

	For __Windows__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-windows.yml
		activate aind-dog
		set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
		python -c "from keras import backend"
	```
6. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
	
	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__


## Amazon Web Services

Instead of training your model on a local CPU (or GPU), you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance.  Please refer to the Udacity instructions for setting up a GPU instance for this project.
